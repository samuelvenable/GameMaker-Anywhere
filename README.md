- Room width and height
- room background colors
- Object and Asset drawing

### Todo (sorted from least to most needed)
- custom variable stuff
- port to other platforms
- rooms (should be pretty easy, it's setup for it)
- and a bunch more...

## compiling
(theres a pre compiled 3dsx and cia inside the output folder \Runners\3DS\output!!!!!)

compiling is currently only recommended with the test project, anything else is almost guaranteed not to work (for now)
this assumes you have devkitpro and citro2d installed
this process will be easier later, just needing you to click the yyp in data.win compiler project

<br>

1. download the repo and extract it to a location without spaces in the path. eg: D:\projects_and_stuff\GameMaker-Anywhere\
2. using gamemaker, open the data.win compiler project and run it 
3. select the yyp of the test project
4. after finishing, go to the test project folder and open the "3DS Data Exported" folder
5. run the "build_sprites_t3x.bat"
6. after completing, copy and paste the data.win to the consoles runner romfs folder
7. copy the t3x in the gfx folder of the test project and copy it in to the romfs gfx folder in the runner
8. copy everything besides the t3x from the test projects gfx folder into the runners root gfx folder
9. open powershell in the root directory of the runner and run make 3dsx
10. if everythings gone right, you should get a 3dsx in the output folder (ignore the rest of the files)
11. (extra) you can compile a cia if you have banner tool and makerom setup, just run make cia instead of make 3dsx
